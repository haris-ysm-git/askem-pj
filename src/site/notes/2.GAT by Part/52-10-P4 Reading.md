## Items 51-55

> The debate about global warming is about the outcome of a gamble. We are betting that the benefits of our industrial and agricultural activities—increasing standards of living for the rich and poor alike—will outweigh possible adverse consequences of an unfortunate by-product of our activities, an increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases that could lead to global warming and global climate changes. Some experts are warning that we are making poor bets, that global warming has started and that disasters are imminent. Others assure that the chances of global warming are so remote that the outcome of our wager will definitely be in our favor. The impasse is disquieting because the issue is of vital importance to each of us; it concerns the habitability of our planet. How long will it be before it is imperative that we take action?  
>  
> Some people are under the false impression that global warming is a theory that still has to be confirmed. They do not realize that scientists are in complete agreement that a continual rise in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases will inevitably lead to global warming and global climate changes. The disagreements are about the timing and amplitude of the expected warming. It is as if we are in a raft, gliding smoothly down a river, towards dangerous rapids and possibly a waterfall, and are uncertain of the distance to the waterfall. If we know what the distance is then we can tackle the very difficult political matter of deciding on the appropriate time to get out of the water. Suppose, however, that  
>  
> the scientific results have uncertainties, that the scientists can do no better than estimate that we will arrive at the waterfall in thirty minutes, plus or minus ten minutes. Pessimists will then insist that we will arrive in 20 minutes or less, while optimists will state confidently that we won't be there for 40 minutes or more. Such disagreements usually result in the postponement of the political decision until more accurate scientific results are available—everyone knows that scientists should be capable of precise predictions—or until we are in sight of the waterfall. We recently had such an experience. It is in our interest to limit the growth in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. It is wise to avoid comprehensive programs that decree a rigid course of action to reach a grand, final solution. It is better to take action, and to correct mistakes at an early stage before scarce resources have been wasted. We are courting a disaster and need to accept that uncertainties do not justify inaction.

## Items 56-60

> Optimistic estimates place computing power equivalence to human brain functions at around or before 2030. Appropriate AI software may or may not be ready by then. A more conservative date would place the readiness of human-equivalent AI robots at around 2050.
> 
> But there is no reason why all robots would have to have full human-equivalent intelligence. If robots are going to be used for specific tasks only, then they could presumably be programmed with that level of intelligence or capability only. Robots designated for mental tasks could be programmed with a full range of general-purpose capabilities but at a lower processing speed, equivalent to a low human IQ.
> 
> It is assumed that most general-purpose robots could be designated to perform most clerical tasks, mental tasks, most manufacturing production line tasks, and similar tasks. Any tasks that include elements of risk or danger would also be primary targets for robot workers.
> 
> It seems reasonable to assume that creative tasks like acting, journalism, fiction writing, politics, executive management, policing, and doctors would remain within the realm of humans.
> 
> But for the majority of jobs currently performed by humans, robots should have adequate intelligence to complete the same tasks with equal or greater efficiency. If their intelligence is equivalent to humans, then robots will also be self-aware. To what extent will this be a problem? Could it be construed that robots have become slaves? To what extent could robots be programmed to suppress self-awareness, and if that were possible, then how much would that affect their ability to complete their work tasks with the same competence as their human owners?
> 
> As time passes, further processor developments will enable robots to have much higher intelligence than humans. This is likely to create at least two classes of robots: one set designed to work in place of their owners, and the other to exist as free individuals. Issues may need to be resolved, though. Should such free robots be permitted to work as themselves and receive income? Should free robots be permitted to own lesser robots to work for them?
