>  **Movie Review**
>  
> Based on the novel by Richard Ford, and adapted by Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan, Wildlife takes us to Great Falls, Montana, in 1960. The Brinsons — mother Jeanette (Cary Mulligan), dad Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould) - are newly arrived in a small Montana town. We learn quickly that money is tight, that this isn't the family's first relocation, and that both Jeanette and Jerry seem preoccupied with the idea of a life other than the one they have.
>
> When Jerry, in the film's early scenes, loses his job at a local golf course, a fault line in the family ruptures. Jerry drinks beer and sulks around the house feeling sorry for himself because his pride is hurt. His old boss admits he made a mistake and tries to hire him again, but Jerry refuses. So Jeanette decides to provide for the family by taking up a part-time job as a swim teacher. Joe, too, lands a job as a photographer's assistant for some extra cash. But the family's tipping point is when Jerry joins a firefighting team battling a blaze on a nearby mountain, leaving his wife behind with Joe. Jeanette has been getting restless herself, gradually losing respect for Jerry as he drifts from one thing to the next. She has an affair with an older, wealthier man, Mr. Miller (Bill Camp).
>
> Wildlife is a domestic drama that is both sad and terrifying. The entire cast does exceptional work (Oxenbould is an exciting find), but the movie is anchored by Mulligan, who gives the best performance of any I've seen in fim this year. It is mesmerizing to watch the character struggle with the question of whether or not she is entitled to her rage before she lets go and gives in to it — and finds that doing so gives her no satisfaction whatsoever.
> 
> Dano's direction is meticulous in every respect, which enables him to keep the characters at a remove that is both clear-eyed and compassionate. The sharp cinematography by Diego Garcia is ideal for Dano's purpose. The whole of the film is a potent collaboration in every respect, and a remarkable directorial debut.
