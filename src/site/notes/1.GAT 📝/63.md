### Passage 2 (Items 36-40)
> If you have ever looked to go on a river cruise in Europe, chances are you will have narrowed down the choices to two renowned rivers: the Rhine and the Danube. The Rhine flows through Germany while the Danube runs primarily through Austria.
> 
> The cruises usually offer land excursions to charming towns. Attractions are within walking distance from where your ship docks. Because these two rivers are major waterways, almost all local river cruise lines operate on these routes, meaning that you have plenty of choices to choose from.
> 
> Both rivers span Europe‚Äôs best scenery, passing cities, castles and many inspiring landscapes. On the Rhine, two of the biggest stops are in the cities of Amsterdam and Cologne. However, be mindful that the Rhine is an industrial river, so working vessels also share the waterway. On the Danube, you have Budapest, with its castle on the hill, along with Vienna, where you can catch a classical music performance or opera almost any night. The scenery is a little greener on the Danube. If you like castles and cathedrals, both rivers will **fit the bill**. On the Rhine, cruises often stop at a 700-year-old castle. On the Danube, you‚Äôll either stop at Melk or Krems, where there are churches.

4. its scenery is not as green as the Danube‚Äôs

1. Both cruises are suitable for travelers interested in castles.
2. When ships dock, travelers can walk to nearby attractions.
3. Traffic is to be expected on both rivers because they are the main rivers in Europe.
4. Travelers need to take a shuttle bus to visit sites during land excursions.
5. Travelers can easily find a good deal themselves because there are many cruises available.

### Passage 3 (Items 41-45)
> Eskimos came to North America from Siberia. So how did they cross the Pacific Ocean? More than 10,000 years ago, there was a land bridge connecting Siberia and Alaska. We cannot see the area today because when the Ice Age ended, ice mountains melted causing ocean water to rise and cover the bridge.
> 
> In the past, Eskimos caught fish and hunted seals for food. Because seal skins were sturdy, Eskimos used them for covering the freezing floors. At times, hunting parties would go inland to hunt caribou, large north American reindeer. Their skins were warmer, and much lighter compared to seal skins, so they were used for clothing and making tents.
> 
> Eskimos lived in tents during summer, but in the winter, they lived in igloos. Igloos were made from blocks of hard-packed snow. The blocks were three feet long, one-and-a-half feet wide, and five inches in height. The blocks were piled up and fitted together. But they were not piled up straight, rather they were set in spiral form. The spiral became smaller toward the top. In this way, a dome was formed. To let some light in, Eskimos set a thin slab of ice into a wall. Igloos stood through the winter because the temperature was very low. Eskimos live in one of the coldest and harshest regions in the world

---
#### 41. The land bridge between Siberia and Alaska \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
1. melted down after the Ice Age
2. was flooded by water from melted ice
