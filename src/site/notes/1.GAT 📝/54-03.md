### Passage 1

> _<1>_ My family and I have watched with interest the swallows that, over the years, have sought out a nest attached to the wall underneath the small terrace of our house. They come and go, and we look forward to their return each spring.
> 
> _<2>_ One day I noticed that the nest had fallen over with the small **occupants** ‚Äî six fat fledglings covered in good plumage ‚Äî still inside. My eight-year-old son arranged an emergency shelter: he put the babies inside a cardboard box, along with bits of cotton wool and a few pieces of the clay from the destroyed nest. When my husband returned home that evening, we considered how we could build a new nest for the swallows.
> 
> _<3>_ After some animated discussion and without hope of success, we decided to put the baby birds in another deeper cardboard box, together with the clay and soft cotton wool. With a few nails in the wall and a few holes in the improvised nest, the box was attached to the wall with its little occupants inside. We worried that our handling of the tiny chicks had left the odor of humans on them. Would the parents, when they returned, become suspicious, or even reject their young ones?
> 
> _<4>_ So we waited anxiously. With dawn came the sound of the parents busily going about the job of feeding six hungry birds! They looked after their brood until the fledglings became self-sufficient; only then did they dedicate themselves to fixing up the new nest we had built.
> 
> _<5>_ Some 22 years later, this nest is still sought out by successive generations of swallows who come and depart ‚Äî the source of renewed happiness and joy for us.

### Passage 2

The mothers were exchanging experiences and talking about their babies, whether **they**'d started teething, crawling, etc.
>

> _<3>_ One of the women at Marigot is a 30-year-old mother who gave birth to a premature baby girl seven months into her pregnancy. Her newborn weighed only 1,600 grams and stayed in an incubator for 13 days. Initially she was going to send her baby girl back to her hometown in Sakon Nakhon after the mandatory three-month childcare leave. However, the mother later changed her mind after she became convinced that feeding her baby girl breast milk would nurture the **frail** baby back to health.
> 
> _<4>_ This mother admitted she feels very lucky that the company understands and supports her in giving her child breast milk. Not only does it save money but it has also strengthened the bond she feels with her child.
> 
> _<5>_ Because the mother didn‚Äôt have to send her child back to her hometown, she is very happy in the workplace, which produces high-quality crystal pieces.
> 
> _<6>_ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have worries while working. When I think of my baby, I am happy and content that she is fast asleep. When my breasts start secreting, I just call a colleague and we go to the corner and start pumping milk for the baby. We meet our friends from other parts of the company and share our experiences,‚Äù she said.

### Passage 3

> _<1>_ A recent study found that resident doctors know when they are exhausted, upset, or overwhelmed and when they are, they are far more likely to admit they made an error. What they are admitting is that sleepiness is not the only factor. Above and beyond that is general distress and mental fatigue, researchers reported in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_.
> 
> _<2>_ ‚ÄúWhile fatigue is important, there is this whole domain of distress beyond fatigue that also demands attention,‚Äù Colin West of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who led the study, said in an interview. The findings may help point to ways to better reduce the burdens on resident doctors, known in some countries as junior doctors, and in turn prevent mistakes. ‚ÄúI think this is going to have an impact on healthcare reform,‚Äù Dr. West said. ‚ÄúWe need to put resources into training and medicine to control work hours and maintain physician well-being.‚Äù
> 
> _<3>_ The US Institute of Medicine reported in 1999 that between 48,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year from preventable medical errors ranging from drug overdoses to infections caught in the hospital. And doctors, unions, and other experts have been **clamoring** to cut the work hours of residents, who are required to work at least 50 hours a week at most training hospitals.
> 
> _<4>_ Dr. West and colleagues surveyed 356 residents at 163 medical schools globally. They found that 39% reported making at least one major medical error during the study period, and these doctors were also more likely to say they were sleepy, fatigued, or stressed. ‚ÄúWhat we have shown in this data is that fatigue is important, but it‚Äôs only part of the issue and previous studies have not paid much attention to the distress factors,‚Äù Dr. West said. ‚ÄúOver the course of their training and the course of their career everyone has made a major error. Everyone tries to be perfect but no one is.‚Äù He said only limiting work hours may not be enough.
> 
> _<5>_ Teaching hospitals across the United States have moved to limit residents‚Äô work weeks to 40 hours to reduce fatigue-related errors. It is estimated that **this** could cost US$171 million to $487 million a year, depending on whether additional residents are hired or substitute providers are brought in.

---

#### 41. What is the main idea of the passage?

1. All resident doctors make at least one mistake while they are training.
2. Psychological as well as physical exhaustion can cause residents to make mistakes.
3. One of the most important factors leading to preventable errors is sleepiness.
4. Cutting resident doctors‚Äô work hours can make them less tired.

---

#### 42. Which of the following is NOT true?

1. The mistakes made by doctors cause thousands of deaths in America each year.
2. Dr. West's research aims to find ways to improve junior doctors‚Äô working conditions.
3. Common mistakes made by hospital residents include drug overdoses.
4. Dr. West's study reveals that fatigue is the only major cause of medical errors.

---

#### 43. Which word is closest in meaning to ‚Äúclamoring‚Äù (paragraph 3)?

1. Demanding
2. Rejecting
3. Announcing
4. Encouraging

---

#### 44. Which of the following is TRUE about studies in the past?

2. They identified three main factors leading to errors.
3. They pointed out that careful doctors made no mistakes.
4. They didn‚Äôt emphasize the role of stress in medical errors.

---

#### 45. What does ‚Äúthis‚Äù (paragraph 5) refer to?

1. Trying to be perfect
2. Being sleepy, fatigued, or stressed
3. Limiting residents‚Äô work hours
4. Hiring additional residents
