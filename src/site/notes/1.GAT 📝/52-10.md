> \_\_\_\_\_(41)\_\_\_\_\_ It is a member of the xanthine group of chemicals, which also includes theophylline, an ingredient used in asthma medication, and theobromine, found in tea and cola drinks. The first verifiable use of caffeine was more than 2,000 years ago among Ethiopian tribesmen who ate a mixture of raw coffee beans and fat. Caffeine has no real nutritional role, but millions of people worldwide insist they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get started‚Äù without a morning cup of coffee. To these people, it is, indeed, important. Recent studies confirm what many caffeine users have long known‚Äîthe substance is addictive, and those who try to give it up suffer withdrawal symptoms. Fortunately, caffeine addiction is relatively benign, especially when compared with addictions to nicotine, alcohol, or illegal drugs.

A survey by supermarket chain Sainsbury's also reveals that \_\_\_\_\_(42)\_\_\_\_\_. The popularity of sandwiches, pizzas, and mezze-style dishes has led to the sofa replacing the dining table for many mealtimes. In addition, almost half of those quizzed said they eat in front of the TV, and 10 percent of young people aged 18-24 use their hands to eat their evening meal. Only 60 percent use a knife and fork at evening meals, with the over-55s likely to keep up the tradition. Among young people, only 10 percent use a knife, fork, and spoon.

4. You might say you need some yellow foliage for the bed that‚Äôs so dark and plain all summer.  

> When creating a garden, you have to choose between simultaneous masses of flowers or a lesser but long-lasting display. That‚Äôs because most plants bloom for a limited period, then quit. Most gardeners start out with a passion for flowers and think almost solely in terms of their color, size, fragrance, and season. Catalogues, magazines, and books encourage this way of thinking by overwhelmingly emphasizing flowers in their photos and write-ups. \_\_\_\_\_(43)\_\_\_\_\_. Healthy leaves in a range of colors, shapes, textures, and sizes can produce a garden that always looks good, whether or not anything is in bloom.

2. Autistic persons have fairly unlimited speech.  
3. The cause of speech and language problems in autism is unknown.  
4. People with autism have no difficulties with both verbal and non-verbal language.  

> \_\_\_\_\_(45)\_\_\_\_\_.

## Items 51-55

> The debate about global warming is about the outcome of a gamble. We are betting that the benefits of our industrial and agricultural activities‚Äîincreasing standards of living for the rich and poor alike‚Äîwill outweigh possible adverse consequences of an unfortunate by-product of our activities, an increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases that could lead to global warming and global climate changes. Some experts are warning that we are making poor bets, that global warming has started and that disasters are imminent. Others assure that the chances of global warming are so remote that the outcome of our wager will definitely be in our favor. The impasse is disquieting because the issue is of vital importance to each of us; it concerns the habitability of our planet. How long will it be before it is imperative that we take action?  
>  
> Some people are under the false impression that global warming is a theory that still has to be confirmed. They do not realize that scientists are in complete agreement that a continual rise in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases will inevitably lead to global warming and global climate changes. The disagreements are about the timing and amplitude of the expected warming. It is as if we are in a raft, gliding smoothly down a river, towards dangerous rapids and possibly a waterfall, and are uncertain of the distance to the waterfall. If we know what the distance is then we can tackle the very difficult political matter of deciding on the appropriate time to get out of the water. Suppose, however, that  
>  
> the scientific results have uncertainties, that the scientists can do no better than estimate that we will arrive at the waterfall in thirty minutes, plus or minus ten minutes. Pessimists will then insist that we will arrive in 20 minutes or less, while optimists will state confidently that we won't be there for 40 minutes or more. Such disagreements usually result in the postponement of the political decision until more accurate scientific results are available‚Äîeveryone knows that scientists should be capable of precise predictions‚Äîor until we are in sight of the waterfall. We recently had such an experience. It is in our interest to limit the growth in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. It is wise to avoid comprehensive programs that decree a rigid course of action to reach a grand, final solution. It is better to take action, and to correct mistakes at an early stage before scarce resources have been wasted. We are courting a disaster and need to accept that uncertainties do not justify inaction.

#### 51. What would be the best title for this text?
1. The Cause of Global Warming  
2. The Effects of Global Warming  
3. Global Warming: A Controversial Issue  
4. An Undisputable Fact of Global Warming

1. Greenhouse Effect is the cause of global warming.  
2. The ways man contributes to greenhouse gases.  
3. Preventive steps should be made against global warming.  
4. Scientists could not settle on the precise prediction of global warming.

1. constant  
2. significant  
3. legible

1. environmental problems  
2. scientific uncertainties

1. creative

## Items 56-60

> Optimistic estimates place computing power equivalence to human brain functions at around or before 2030. Appropriate AI software may or may not be ready by then. A more conservative date would place the readiness of human-equivalent AI robots at around 2050.
> 
> But there is no reason why all robots would have to have full human-equivalent intelligence. If robots are going to be used for specific tasks only, then they could presumably be programmed with that level of intelligence or capability only. Robots designated for mental tasks could be programmed with a full range of general-purpose capabilities but at a lower processing speed, equivalent to a low human IQ.
> 
> It is assumed that most general-purpose robots could be designated to perform most clerical tasks, mental tasks, most manufacturing production line tasks, and similar tasks. Any tasks that include elements of risk or danger would also be primary targets for robot workers.
> 
> It seems reasonable to assume that creative tasks like acting, journalism, fiction writing, politics, executive management, policing, and doctors would remain within the realm of humans.
> 
> But for the majority of jobs currently performed by humans, robots should have adequate intelligence to complete the same tasks with equal or greater efficiency. If their intelligence is equivalent to humans, then robots will also be self-aware. To what extent will this be a problem? Could it be construed that robots have become slaves? To what extent could robots be programmed to suppress self-awareness, and if that were possible, then how much would that affect their ability to complete their work tasks with the same competence as their human owners?
> 
> As time passes, further processor developments will enable robots to have much higher intelligence than humans. This is likely to create at least two classes of robots: one set designed to work in place of their owners, and the other to exist as free individuals. Issues may need to be resolved, though. Should such free robots be permitted to work as themselves and receive income? Should free robots be permitted to own lesser robots to work for them?

#### 56. What is the text mainly about?
1. robot functions  
2. human brains  
3. computing power  
4. general purpose robots  

---

#### 57. What time does the writer refer to when he mentions ‚Äúa more conservative date‚Äù?
1. after 2050  
2. around 2030  
3. before 2050  
4. around 2050
