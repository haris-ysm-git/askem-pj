### Passage 2  
> *<1>* As a preschooler, Amanda Sprague would cling to her mum or dad around new people, slept with the bedroom door wide open and the hall light on, and was **skittish about** bugs. To her parents, this didn‚Äôt seem all that unusual for her age. But when she started school, Amanda‚Äôs worries multiplied and intensified, says Laurie, her mother. She would cower in bed, paralyzed with fear during a thunderstorm. When she spotted two ladybugs on the ceiling, she ran screaming from her bedroom and refused to go to sleep.  
> *<2>* Food was also a major source of anxiety for Amanda, and she constantly worried about choking. When she was eight, she suddenly stopped eating completely. ‚ÄúShe said she couldn't swallow and thought something was stuck in her throat,‚Äù says her mother. ‚ÄúOur doctor ruled out a throat infection and X-rays showed nothing was medically wrong with her.‚Äù  
> *<3>* Days later Amanda developed a morbid fear of dying. She cried at bedtime and thought her heart was beating too fast. Admitted to hospital, she was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. She was so anxious that her throat had **constricted**, making swallowing impossible.  
> *<4>* Amanda's case is extreme, but it represents the tip of a serious problem facing youngsters today. Experts suggest that thousands of children experience anxiety disorders such as this. Many more struggle with anxiety problems ‚Äî the mid-range anxiety that is above normal but not extreme.  
> *<5>* Children often suffer on their own because they don‚Äôt recognize that they have a problem, don‚Äôt understand what's happening to them, or can‚Äôt explain their feelings. Parents might overlook or minimize their child's problem. Or they might have trouble interpreting the signs‚Äîchildren can express anxiety in many ways, from extreme shyness to irritability or even defiance.

#### Passage 3

> <1> Ferns were once thought to be magical plants. That's because they bear neither flowers nor fruit nor seeds, yet a new plant emerges, seemingly out of nowhere. We now know that ferns grow from spores. but there was a time when it was believed they did bear flowers. According to a legend, ferns bore flowers before the birth of Christ. When Jesus Christ was born, the plants around his birthplace burst into bloom in celebration, with the exception of the ferns. For this failure, ferns were condemned to a flowerless state from that day on.  
> <2> According to another legend, ferns flowered only at night. The flowers, which were said to be of beautiful blue color, opened very quickly and just as quickly faded, which was why no one ever saw them. The flowers were then replaced by golden seeds that ripened by midnight, but as no one had ever seen a fern seed, it was thought that they were invisible, like the flowers.  
> <3> It was believed that possession of the invisible seeds would also make one invisible. Consequently, many devious plans were devised to secure the valuable fern seed. One plan involved 12 pewter plates stacked on top of one another and held under the fern plant at midnight on St John‚Äôs Eve (June 24), the only time the invisible seeds would ripen and fall from the plant.  
> <4> According to the legend, the falling seeds would pass right through the first 11 plates before landing on the 12th. Only then could **they** be obtained‚Äîif one was careful enough. More often than not, however, the slightest gust of wind would blow them away, so if the collector did not become invisible afterwards, he would know he had failed to secure the invisible seeds.  
> <5> As late as the 1800s, some scientists insisted that ferns must have flowers and seeds like any other plant. It was only later that they realized ferns **propagated** by spores, which differ from seeds in that they consist of a single cell. Seeds, on the other hand, consist of many cells and contain young underdeveloped plants. It is almost magical how a tiny seed can grow into a huge tree. But it seems there are plants that are more magical than others.  
---

#### 41. What is the main idea of this passage?

1. Ferns are not magical plants, but they grow from spores.  
2. Despite tireless effort to secure fern seeds, they remain invisible.  
3. Fern flowers and seeds were condemned when Jesus was born.  
4. Fern flowers yield spores and then quickly fade by midnight.  
---

1. They bloom a beautiful blue color.  
2. They are replaced by golden seeds at midnight.  
3. They can be seen with the naked eye.  
4. Ferns do not produce flowers.  
---

#### 43. According to a legend, which of the following is NOT true about fern seeds?

2. They disappear quickly by midnight.  
3. They can only be secured on Christmas Eve.  
4. A gust of wind can easily blow them away.  
---

#### 44. What does ‚Äúthey‚Äù (paragraph 4) refer to?
