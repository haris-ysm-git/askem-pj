> 
> According to *The Travels of Marco Polo* written by an Italian who once traveled in China during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), servants serving the emperor during meals needed to wear silk scarves to cover their mouths and noses.

Scented spices or medicines including mint leaves were placed in the beak section to filter out disease.
