### Passage 1  
> *<1>* While some researchers search for the roots of obesity in our genes, others investigate infections. Scientists have known for two decades that, surprisingly, certain viruses can cause birds or mammals to become fat. Now scientists think they have tracked down a bug that can cause obesity in people.
> 
> *<2>* The alleged **culprit** is human adenovirus-36, or AD-36. A study published in 2002 showed that AD-36 injected into monkeys causes dramatic weight gain. In some animals, the injected virus caused body fat to triple. It’s unethical to inoculate people with viruses, of course. But in an analysis of 1,000 people, the scientists found that **those** with AD-36 antibodies—a sign that they have been infected—are significantly more likely to be overweight.
> 
> *<3>* How could a virus make you fat? When fat cells are exposed to AD-36, they begin to multiply. “We are not saying all obesity is caused by a virus. Genes, metabolism, and habits all play a role,” the scientists acknowledge. “But at least one other possibility appears to be infection.”
> 
> *<4>* As yet, no one knows how widespread AD-36 may be, or how big a role it might play in the current obesity epidemic. If the scientists’ suspicions prove correct, the next step would be to develop a vaccine.  

---

### Passage 2  
> <1> At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, psychology professor Bella DePaulo got 77 students and 70 townspeople to volunteer for an unusual project. All kept diaries for a week, recording the numbers and details of the lies they told.  
> <2> One student and six Charlottesville residents professed to have told no falsehoods. The other 140 participants told 1,535.  
> <3> The lies were most often not what most of us would call earth-shattering. Someone would pretend to be more positive or supportive of a spouse or friend than he or she really was, or feign agreement with a relative’s opinion. According to DePaulo, women in their interactions with other women lied mostly **to spare others’ feelings**. Men lied to other men generally for self-promoting reasons.  
> <4> Most strikingly, **these tellers-of-a-thousand-lies** reported that their deceptions caused them “a little preoccupation or regret.” Might that, too, be a lie? Perhaps. But there is evidence that this attitude toward casual use of prevarication is common.  
> <5> Think how often we hear the expressions “I’ll call you” or “The check is in the mail” or “I’m sorry, but he stepped out.” And then there are professions—lawyers, pundits, public relations consultants—whose members seem to specialize in shaping or spinning the truth to suit clients’ needs.  

---

1. Male and Female Lies  
2. The Truth about Lies

---

1. Male and female liars  
2. DePaulo’s students

4. Participants in DePaulo’s study  

---

### Passage 3  
> <1> Chemicals from air-conditioning units and refrigerators in daily use throughout Asia could cause catastrophic climate change unless we change our ways soon, scientists say. Called hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the chemicals were widely adopted about 20 years ago after it was discovered that the chemicals being used until then—chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)—had been **depleting** the ozone layer.  
> <2> The scientists say what has been beneficial for the ozone layer could be disastrous for the world’s climate, because HCFCs turn into “super greenhouse gases,” some of them nearly 5,000 times stronger than carbon dioxide.  
> <3> As long as they stay inside our air-conditioners and refrigerators, HCFCs are harmless coolants, colorless and odorless. But when they leak into the air, they become what scientists call fluorinated greenhouse gases, or F-gases.  
> <4> Unfortunately, leaks are normal. Most residential air-conditioners have natural leakage of 5% per year, according to the UN. Poor maintenance can increase **that** to 50%. And if the machine is dumped without recovering the coolant, the figure jumps to 100%.  
> <5> A report published earlier this year shows that in a worst-case scenario, F-gases could be responsible for as much as 45% of total global warming by 2050, and Asia will be the main contributor.  
> <6> “F-gas emissions in developing countries are projected to be as much as 800% greater than in developed countries in 2050,” reports a climate scientist working under Guus Velders of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.  
> <7> Alarm bells have not stopped ringing since his report came out in June, and the race is now on to deploy substitutes for F-gases which otherwise will wipe out much of the potential benefit of whatever agreements emerge from climate talks in Copenhagen next month.  
> <8> The UN agencies involved with climate change knew all along that F-gases had high global-warming potential, but they said the amounts involved were so small that they wouldn’t have a significant impact.  
> <9> The chemical companies also knew of the dangers, but they continued to lead their shareholders to believe that F-gases were good for the environment.  

---

#### 41. What is the purpose of this passage?  
1. To show figures for air conditioner use in Asia  
2. To point out the danger posed by a household appliance in Asia  
3. To explain how super greenhouse gases damage the ozone layer  
4. To describe the characteristics of HCFCs  

---

#### 42. Which is closest in meaning to the word “depleting” (paragraph 1)?

3. Many scientists are worried about the possible effect of F-gases on climate change.  
4. Chemical companies have tried to limit F-gases in the environment.  

---

#### 44. What releases the highest level of greenhouse gases into the environment?  
1. Regular use of old air-conditioners  
2. Dumping air-conditioners with coolants  
3. Dumping air-conditioners without coolants  
4. Poor maintenance of air-conditioners  

---

#### 45. What does “that” (paragraph 4) refer to?  
1. The leakage of F-gases  
2. Information from the UN  
3. Poor maintenance  
4. Air-conditioning
