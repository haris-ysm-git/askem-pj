### Passage 1

> *<1>* Children with aggressive behavior can be helped in two ways: with prevention and by treating the symptoms as the aggression occurs.
>   
> *<2>* Preventing behavior before it emerges requires good parenting. By staying in control of their emotions, not using force, using creative ways to solve problems, and speaking in a kind, soft tone, parents can provide positive examples for their children. If parents cannot do this, it will be difficult for children to learn good behavior. Another preventive measure is to make the family atmosphere warm, relaxed, and secure. In **this sort of environment**, the children will grow up to be contented adults, in control of their emotions.
> 
> *<3>* Not only do parents need to set an example, but they have to teach their children how to express their unhappy feelings appropriately. Children must learn to consider other people‚Äôs feelings. Cooling down anger by counting from one to ten, practicing breathing exercises, learning how to forgive, or praising good behavior are several ways **they** can be taught.
> 
> *<4>* Correcting a child‚Äôs behavior is not an easy task. It takes a great deal of determination, effort, and consistency. However, it is worth all the effort.

---

#### 31. What is this passage mainly about?

1. How to control children‚Äôs unhappy feelings
2. How to help aggressive children
3. How to discipline ill-behaved children
4. How to learn about children‚Äôs behaviors

---

#### 32. Which word does NOT describe ‚Äúthis sort of environment‚Äù (paragraph 2)?

---

#### 33. Which is NOT an example of good parenting?

1. Controlling emotions
2. Treating children inconsistently
3. Speaking with a kind tone
4. Finding creative solutions to problems

---

#### 34. Which statement would the writer agree with the most?

1. We cannot correct children‚Äôs aggressive behavior.
2. We can prevent aggression in our children.
3. Aggressive behavior is sometimes good for children.
4. Aggression in children is not a serious concern.

---

#### 35. What does ‚Äúthey‚Äù (paragraph 3) refer to?

1. Parents

3. Unhappy feelings
4. Breathing exercises

### Passage 2

> *<1>* Dogs can suffer from anorexia, a condition that can occur in both normal and abnormal pets. Symptoms are evident when the owner places food in front of the dog and the animal does not pay attention, not even sniffing at the food. In some cases, the dog will just walk away.
> 
> *<2>* Anorexia can be divided into two kinds. The first, which affects male animals more often than females, is when the pet is not physically ill. For instance, some dogs develop anorexia or related eating problems when they have a new owner, move to a new house, or experience some other stressful event that affects their emotional health. In other cases, anorexia is the result of owners spoiling their pets. When a dog refuses to eat a certain kind of food, the owner may look for another brand that the pet will eat. Now the pet understands how to get its master‚Äôs attention, and so it becomes increasingly selective over what it eats. Over time, this can lead to anorexia.
> 
> *<3>* The second and more common kind of anorexia is when the pet is really sick. There can be many causes. Dehydration, for example, can lead to low blood pressure, depression, and weakness. Ultimately, the pet may lose its ability to eat. Other **ailments** that can contribute to anorexia are diseases of the liver and kidneys, diabetes, and problems with blood circulation.
> 
> *<4>* We can prevent anorexia in several ways, but it starts with observing the pet‚Äôs behavior at meal time. First, if you notice that your pet is not eating properly, try to observe its reaction and compare it with a normal scenario. Also, try to observe whether it vomits or has a bad stomach. When a new pet is brought into the house, you should not change the food immediately. Try to give it the same type of food it is accustomed to eating. **This** will reduce the animal's stress. Pet owners should also train their pets to eat at fixed times. If they do not eat at meal time, take the bowl of food away after 10-15 minutes. Pets can do without a meal for one whole day.
> 
> *<5>* It is important for the pet owner to notice other types of behavior, such as their pet‚Äôs bowel movements, whether it is vomiting, how much interest it shows in playing around, and its appetite for snacks as well. It is definitely not normal when the pet won't eat its favorite snack. In this case, consult a local veterinarian immediately. The vet should be able to make a diagnosis based on past behavior, a blood test, urine analysis, and/or X-rays. Certain adjustments can be made to change the pet‚Äôs behavior if it seems to be suffering from anorexia and is not really ill.

---

#### 36. What is true about anorexia?
1. It may result from other illnesses such as diabetes and liver disease.  
2. It does not affect pets whose owners give them a proper diet.  
3. Stress is the most frequent cause of anorexia in dogs.  
4. Anorexia can generally be treated by changing the pet's food.

---

#### 37. Which of the following is closest in meaning to ‚Äúailments‚Äù (paragraph 3)?
1. Behaviors  
2. Weaknesses  
3. Illnesses  
4. Bowel movements

---

#### 38. What does ‚ÄúThis‚Äù (paragraph 4) refer to?
1. Suddenly changing the pet's food  
2. Giving the pet food it is used to eating  
3. Bringing a new pet into the house  
4. Feeding the pet at meal time

---

#### 39. How might a perfectly healthy dog develop anorexia?
1. The owner allows the dog to choose its food.  
2. The owner takes the dog for blood and urine analysis.  
3. Its bowl of food is taken away after 10-15 minutes.  
4. It does not sniff at its food.

---

#### 40. What can be concluded from the passage?
1. Pet owners should be attentive to their pets‚Äô eating habits because pets can suffer from eating disorders like people do.  
2. Pet owners should observe their pets during mating season because they suffer from anorexia.  
3. Training dogs to eat at fixed times will prevent them from vomiting and having a bad stomach.  
4. When pets suffer from anorexia, owners should increase their appetite by feeding them their favorite snacks.

---

### Passage 3
> *<1>* Some ecological changes have important ecological consequences. Three well-documented global changes are increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle, and ongoing land use or land cover change. Human activity, now primarily fossil fuel combustion, has increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. **This** is likely to have climatic consequences and direct effects on all of the planet's terrestrial ecosystems.
> 
> *<2>* The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity so much that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity than by nature. This added nitrogen **alters** the chemistry of the atmosphere and aquatic ecosystems, and has a substantial impact on biological diversity, especially in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.
> 
> *<3>* Finally, human land use or land cover change has transformed half of the Earth's ice-free surface. **This**, in and of itself, probably represents the most important component of global change now and in the future, with profound implications for biological diversity around the world.
> 
> *<4>* These three and other equally critical components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused, in turn, by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population.

---

#### 41. What is the best title for this passage?
1. Global Environmental Conditions  
2. Changes in the Global Nitrogen Cycle  
3. Consequences of Global Warming  
4. Human-Caused Ecological Changes

---

#### 42. What does ‚ÄúThis‚Äù (paragraph 1) refer to?
1. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations  
2. Having climatic consequences  
3. The Earth's atmosphere  
4. The global nitrogen cycle

---

#### 43. Which word is closest in meaning to ‚Äúalters‚Äù (paragraph 2)?
1. Changes  
2. Fixes  
3. Directs  
4. Demonstrates

---

#### 44. What does ‚ÄúThis‚Äù (paragraph 3) refer to?
1. Biological diversity in affected areas  
2. Half of the Earth‚Äôs ice-free surface  
3. Development of ecosystems of affected areas  
4. Transformation of the Earth‚Äôs ice-free surface

---

#### 45. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?
1. Higher global nitrogen levels are only caused by human activity.  
2. Burning fossil fuel results in higher concentrations of carbon dioxide.  
3. There are only three causes contributing to global environmental change.  
4. The change of the nitrogen cycle does not affect biological diversity.
