#### 42.
1. With luck, you will have arrived shortly before the last tourist bus departs.
2. Your first sight of Machu Picchu in the distance will be your most marvelous time of life.
3. You will never forget the very instant you lay your eyes on the great Incan city that is your goal.

> Beholding the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu as they rise from the Peruvian jungle is a joy that deserves to be on everyone’s travel wish list. But did you know that there is more than one way to arrive at this World Heritage Site? How you approach Machu Picchu is going to affect your experience of it, so consider the options carefully before you embark on this once-in-a-lifetime experience. The quickest and easiest way is, as you would expect, to follow the crowd by taking a four-hour train from Cuzco to a small town of Aguas Calientes. From there, a 20-minute bus journey transports them to the famous ruins. The hardest way, on the other hand, involves joining a guided trek of the long Inca Trail. However, our favorite approach is the short Inca Trail. For this, guides are necessary, and you will be paying upwards of $250. How is that for a sense of arrival? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

#### 44.

2. Greenhouses are commonly found in cold countries.
3. Most greenhouses work in the same way as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
4. Greenhouses are often used to grow plants in a tropical region.

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Greenhouses work by trapping heat from the sun. The glass panels of the greenhouse let in light but keep heat from escaping. This causes the greenhouse to heat up, much like the inside of a car parked in sunlight, and keep the plants warm enough to live.

---
#### 45.
1. people can save the environment by depositing waste for recycling.
2. You can throw away waste to save on the costs and energy.
3. Waste such as paper, cardboard or plastic bottles should be biodegradable.
4. This can prevent reusable materials being buried in land fill waste sites.

> Everyone should recycle as much of their waste as possible. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Recycling does not cost anything, takes only a little extra time, and can make an amazing difference to the world. It is important for everyone to use recycled products without any loss in quality.

## Items 51-55

> No matter where you live or when you were born, you almost surely have at least a small amount of DDT stored in the fatty tissues of your body. Why? This notorious toxic pesticide, which led to the extinction of the American bald eagle in 1970s, has long been banned in the U.S. and most other developed countries. But according to a new report by the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, DDT is still used in many developing nations, mainly because it’s so effective in controlling mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite.
> 
> The persistence of DDT is a problem—and not just in the countries that use it. DDT and several other common chlorine-containing pesticides are sturdy molecules that can stay intact for decades. They evaporate into the atmosphere and are blown by the wind all over the globe. They condense and fall to the ground in cold weather, especially in higher altitudes. Some of the highest concentrations of DDT are found in polar bears, penguins and the Inuit people of northern Canada
> 
> Although levels of DDT contamination are gradually falling in countries where the pesticide has been banned, new scientific research suggests that the chemicals are still a serious threat everywhere. Studies show that even small amounts of pesticides can disrupt the working of human hormones, interfering with reproduction and the functioning of the immune system. That’s why representatives of more than 100 nations gathered at a U.N. meeting in Nairobi to work toward a global treaty that would phase out DDT and 11 other pesticides, known as the “dirty dozen.” Environmentalists say it’s possible to find alternative way to fight malaria—and get rid of DDT once and for all

1. manipulative
2. obstructive
3. uncooperative

1. DDT is still around—and still a menace
2. Where there is DDT, there is no malaria
3. Get rid of DDT in order to save wildlife
4. DDT contamination is a trivial threat everywhere 

---
#### 53. Which of the following does the writer conclude at the end?
1. DDT is the most effective chemical in controlling mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite.
2. A small amount of pesticides can disrupt the working of both human hormone and immune system.
3. The molecules of DDT and several other common chlorine-containing pesticides cannot be damaged for many years.
4. A global treaty that would phase out DDT and 11 other notorious toxic pesticides should be enacted very soon.

---
#### 54. Why does the writer refer to the new scientific research?
1. to state the impact linked to DDT and other pesticides
2. to illustrate the serious threats caused by DDT and other pesticides
3. to show the amounts of DDT and other pesticides involved with human hormones
4. to explain the effectiveness of DDT and other pesticides in controlling mosquitoes

---

3. Giving examples of the hazardous effects of DDT on human health, wildlife, and plants
4. Discussing the persistence and effects of DDT and several other pesticides found all over the globe

## Items 56-60

> When asked about the future of TV and of video on the internet, people reveal profound differences in attitudes based on age groups, We asked people ages 12-64 if they agreed with two statements about the future of TV and competition with the computer for entertainment time. When asked whether they agreed that “the computer increasingly competes with the TV for my entertainment time,” 29% of people said they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. Males overall agreed at a slightly higher rate than females, and, importantly when looking at future trends, the younger generation of 18-to-24-year-olds was considerably more focused on the computer as competition for the TV; 36% agreed vs. 29% for the total population. Only 25% of 35-to 44-year-olds said the computer competes with the TV for entertainment. When we asked consumers if the internet represents “the future” of video viewing, the group that agreed most strongly was the 18-to-24 group with 28% of men agreeing and 20% of women. Clearly, the 18-to-24 population is leading the way in adopting new paradigms for entertainment.
